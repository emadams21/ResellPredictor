# Resell Predictor Tool

Are you sneakerhead that has trouble finding the next hotest shoe to collect or Resell? Well Ive created a model based on 90,000 different shoe sales from StockX one of the most popular reselling websites in the world. Our model is so well that we are able to predict within $70 USD of the actual shoe price. (See below for further detials.)  


# Business Understanding

The business problems That I am trying to solve is to help high end shoe resellers be able to gain competitive advantages when it comes to knowing what shoes to buy and give them the most bang for their buck. I want them to be able to put in what type of shoe they want and then predict the resell price of that. 

# Data Understanding

"The data in this project consist of a random sample of all U.S. Off-White x Nike and Yeezy 350 sales from between 9/1/2017 and 2/13/2019. 
This was from a data contest that StockX provided.

To create this sample, I collected a random, fixed percentage of StockX sales (X%) for each colorway, on each day, since September, 2017. So, for each day the Off-White Jordan 1 was on the market, we randomly selected X% of its sale from each day. (It’s not important to know what X is; all that matters is that it’s a random sample, and that the same fixed X% of sales was selected from every day, for every sneaker). The sample was limited to U.S. sales only.

We’ve included 8 variables for you to work with: Order Date, Brand, Sneaker Name, Sale Price ($), Retail Price ($), Release Date, Shoe Size, and Buyer Region (the state the buyer shipped to). You can use whatever variables you want in the analysis; you can use 1

What kind of preprocessing steps do you foresee (encoding, matrix transformations, etc.)? 
What are some of the cleaning/pre-processing challenges for this data?

# Modeling and Evaluation
What modeling techniques are most appropriate for your problem?
What is your target variable? (remember - we require that you answer/solve a supervised problem for the capstone, thus you will need a target)
Is this a regression or classification problem?

# Conclusion
What metrics will you use to determine success (MAE, RMSE, etc.)?
